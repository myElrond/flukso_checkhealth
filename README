This little utility is intended to act as a swiss army knife for accessing various data and functions build around the Flukso power metering device, which is used in the http://www.mysmartgrid.de projekt.

It is currently in a very early stage and has only a few functions:

1. Output the last valid value delivered to the database on the website
2. Check the freshness of the delivery process.
